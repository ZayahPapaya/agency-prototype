# Notes for game

## Obvious spell properties

Range, element, base damage, targets, name

There are 7 catagories to the world, distributed in a wheel.

            Shade
   Spirit           Decay
           Machine
   Arcane           Primal
           Radiant

Spirit, Shadow, and Decay, are often associated with evil but in reality make up the world just as much as the opposing side.

Spirit is the life in all things, and provides healing
Shade protects from the harsh light, and comfort to the home
Decay is the natural processes of time and the material changing
Arcane is raw magic in its purest form
Radiant is light and searing heat, purifying the world
Primal is the natural and physical world, including people
Machine is unbiased, an empty vessel waiting to be assumed

Arcane is progress forward, and an impetus upon the material - Opposite to decay, which reverts to lesser forms but changes just as much
Primal is life and the physical - Opposite to the Spirit that leaves it
Radiant is light and divinity - Opposite to Shade, dark and unknown
Machine reflects its users' purpose and acts as such

Druids, for example, might embody Primal and Decay. The circle of life, the wearing sands, and even the sands of time. Druids may double as Necromancers, or even Time Mages

## Class Ideas

### Artillerist

Primal + Machine + Radiant?
Primal = shotgun durability, grit, fire blasts
Machine = guns, turrets, bombs
Radiant? = scorched earth blasts from afar? Could be decay too
Area of effect oriented class.
Has two stances / modes: Shotgun and Mortar
Shotgun is bruiser, melee range cones and bonuses to durability
Mortar is long range shells, blast areas and non-LoS targetting
Class should benefit from the Range stat. Shotgun converts range to Block %, Mortar gains bonus Damage %
Mortar should have multiple roles. Lingering damage zones similar to Feca glyphs, or full up front damage. DoT doesn't crit, would prefer raw damage.
Shotgun should instead choose bruiser or full tank. Gain armor or remove MP / resists in point blank. Gain increased block effectiveness to tank.
Class might have either Scout, or payoffs for Scouted.
Both stances could have an ammo / shells mechanic. Stack shells, next spell cast expends shells to multi-cast. Artillery barrage or chain shotgun blasts. Synergizes with armor stacking for tank, or simply raw burst damage for artillery.
